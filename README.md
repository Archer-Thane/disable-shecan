## Installation

You can install `enable-shecan` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g enable-shecan
```

This will allow you to run the `enable-shecan` command from anywhere.

## Usage

After installing, you can run the command using:

```bash
sudo enable-shecan
```

Please note that in many systems, writing to `/etc/resolv.conf` requires administrative (root) privileges, so you need to use `sudo` before the command.
